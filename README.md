This Script requires the `phonenumbers` library, if you don't already have it, run `pip install phonenumbers`

THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PERPOSES ONLY, IF YOU INDEND ON USING THIS FOR THE WRONG PURPOSE I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBlE FOR YOUR ACTIONS, YOU WILL BE DOING SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

The code snippet uses the `phonenumbers` library to parse a phone number and retrieve its geographical location and carrier information.
Hereâ€™s a breakdown:
`Geolocation`: The `geocoder.description_for_number` function retrieves the location (country, region) based on the phone number.
`Carrier Info`: The `carrier.name_for_number` function gets the name of the service provider for the given phone number.

This code should work for tracking the location and carrier of valid phone numbers.
Just make sure the phone number format is correct.

Enjoy :)
